### Research Assistant | University of California Merced | November 2022 - May 2023
Developed a cubic interpolation method for video frame rate enhancement by incorporating the derivative of acceleration (Jerk) with deep learning. Applied optical flow estimation techniques, including PWC-Net, to improve the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of interpolated images by 20% using PyTorch and CUDA.

### Software Engineer Intern | Morning Star | August 2022 - December 2022
Led a computer vision project using Yolov4 Tiny and DeepSort for real-time detection, tracking, and counting of tomatoes during harvesting. Managed data extraction and labeling for a 3,000-image dataset, which facilitated efficient model training. Developed a notification system to alert operators when tomato counts exceeded thresholds. The project achieved 78% accuracy and was recognized as the Top Finisher at the Innovate to Grow Event.

## Relevant Projects

### Delivery Simulation
A package delivery simulator was developed at UC Berkeley, integrating SQL, MongoDB, and Redis for dynamic real-time feedback. Neo4J was utilized for route optimization and live truck tracking, significantly enhancing logistics efficiency through real-time updates and optimized routing.

### Analyzing Airbnb Listings in NYC (2019)
Performed a detailed analysis of NYC Airbnb 2019 data, engineering features and comparing various predictive models for pricing accuracy. Selected the best-performing model to optimize rental price predictions based on key metrics.

### Image Classification with Transfer Learning
Transfer learning techniques were implemented using pre-trained models such as VGG16 and ResNet50 to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving an accuracy of 85%.

### Time Series Forecasting and Statistical Analysis of CO2 Emissions Trends
Time series forecasting models, including ARIMA and SARIMA, were developed to analyze trends and seasonal patterns in CO2 emissions data. Extensive statistical analysis, including residual diagnostics and model validation, was conducted to ensure robust predictions. Anomalies in the data were identified and corrected, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the forecasting models.

The data spans from 1958 to 1997, using ARIMA to predict both near-term (2022) and long-term (2100) CO2 levels. The upper, expected, and lower bounds indicate when CO2 concentrations are likely to cross critical thresholds of 420 ppm and 500 ppm. These projections help in understanding potential future CO2 trends under various scenarios, providing valuable insights into long-term environmental planning and policy-making.
